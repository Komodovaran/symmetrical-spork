**About**

This is a small collection of scripts for generating traces that emulate real traces that one obtains from TIRFM smFRET (total internal resonance fluorescence microscopy single molecule FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer). The number of states, transition rates and bleaching time can all be easily adjusted to match real-life observations.

**How to use**

1. Generate traces with desired features running <code>traces.py</code>.
2. Run <code>graphs.py</code> to generate graphs. Set desired analysis methods at top of script.
